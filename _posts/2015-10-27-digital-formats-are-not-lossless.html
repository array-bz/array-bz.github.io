  Piracy reduced the music experience to an audio file download.<br>
  An audio file that ended up in your mp3 players spreadsheet-like interface.<br>
  The record store experience of browsing through records in plywood boxes was replaced with a search field.<br>
  All the music you wanted, for free.<br>
  The retail interactions are gone.<br>
  The commitment of physically searching has gone.<br>
  Surreptitious discovery has gone.<br>
  The exposure to merchandise and the brand of an artist has gone.<br>
  But so too has the perceived value of a song, an album, an artists work.<br>
</p>

<p>
  Streaming and download services have improved the quality of digital music experience.<br>
  Discovery of new artists was made easier than ever.<br>
  Collecting and listening across all of your devices is seamless.<br>
  The experience is more convenient than ever and artists and labels are remunerated.<br>
</p>

<p>
  The cost of a track is low, ~69p, about the same as a cigarette.<br>
  But the experience is still cheap too.<br>
  The track is downloaded, played, and that's it.<br>
  The brand and experience of the medium dominate the brand and experience of the artist.<br>
  Your music exists in a closed ecosystem, with all behavior defined by the vendor and licenses.<br>

  <h2>What if every song is an app with game-like capabilities.</h2>

  <p>
    Thinking of a song as an app, a production could include graphics, video, sounds, interaction etc.<br>
    It could just be a video of someone performing.<br>
    It could include a game.<br>
    Or a chat room.<br>
    Or a merchandise shop.<br>
    Or none of that.<br>
    It could just stand alone, play the track, and have a standard API so that it can be included in playlist apps.<br>

  <h2>What if I can subscribe to a song or artist rather than a service.</h2>

  <p>
    And then the app would notify you if there was a gig on playing the song.<br>
    If there was a live production, you get the recording. And the video.<br>
    Listeners replaced vinyl with tapes with CD. They begrudged having to do it just to hear it again, but they would buy into better quality sound.<br>

  <h2>What if interactivity makes piracy irrelevant.</h2>

  <p>
    Instead of all of the behaviors being defined by one house, there could be an open ecosystem of tools. For artists to create digital. productions. For listeners to collection and discover and interact.<br>
    Maybe itâ€™s just than no single house has nailed it yet.<br>
    Or maybe the problem space is too big to be designed sufficiently.<br>
    Maybe the next step for digital music means creating an experience that feels like music instead of managing a file system.<br>

    Digital formats are not lossless.<br>
    They lose everything except the sound.
