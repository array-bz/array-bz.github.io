<p>
  This is a purist's issue with the experience of digital content.
</p>

<p>
  Technology products glorify the medium at the expense of intimacy with the content.<br>
  Spotify, Windows, YouTube, Facebook, iTunes, even Pages.<br>
  The user wants to experience the content.<br>
  The company spends a lot of time on the medium.<br>
  The significance of the medium get's sold to the user.<br>
  The user is interested in the medium only by proxy of the content.<br>
  In the purest experience, the medium would be completely invisible and the user would interact only with the content.<br>
  Branding competes for attention with experience of content.<br>
