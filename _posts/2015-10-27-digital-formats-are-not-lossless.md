Piracy reduced the music experience to an audio file download.
An audio file that ended up in your mp3 players spreadsheet-like interface.
The record store experience of browsing through records in plywood boxes was replaced with a search field.
All the music you wanted, for free.

Streaming and download services have improved the quality of digital music experience and reduced piracy.
Discovery of new artists was made easier than ever.
Collecting and listening across all of your devices is seamless.
The experience is more convenient than ever and artists and labels are remunerated.

But the interactions during the retail experience are lost.
The commitment to physically searching no longer applies.
Surreptitious discovery is a separate act.
The exposure to merchandise and the brand of an artist has been replace with the brand of the medium.
Those experiences and behaviors contributed to the perceived value of music.

The cost of a track is low, ~69p, about the same as a cigarette.
But now the experience is cheap too.
The track is downloaded, played, and the experience ends.
The brand and experience of the medium dominate the brand and experience of the artist.
Your music exists in a closed ecosystem, with all behavior defined by the vendor and licenses.

## What if every song is an app with game-like capabilities.

Thinking of a song as an app, a production could include graphics, video, sounds, interaction etc.
It could just be a video of someone performing.
It could include a game.
Or a chat room.
Or a merchandise shop.
Or none of that.
It could just stand alone, play the track, and have a standard API so that it can be included in playlist apps.


## What if I can subscribe to a song or artist rather than a service.

And then the app would notify you if there was a gig on playing the song.
If there was a live production, you get the recording. And the video.
Listeners replaced vinyl with tapes with CD. They begrudged having to do it just to hear it again, but they would buy into better quality sound.

## What if interactivity makes piracy irrelevant.

Instead of all of the behaviors being defined by one house, there could be an open ecosystem of tools. Tools for artists to create digital productions. Tools for listeners to collect, discover and interact.
Maybe itâ€™s just than no single software-house has nailed it yet.
Or maybe the problem space is too big to be designed sufficiently.
Maybe the next step for digital music means creating an experience that feels like music instead of managing a file system.

Digital formats are not lossless.
They lose everything except the sound.
