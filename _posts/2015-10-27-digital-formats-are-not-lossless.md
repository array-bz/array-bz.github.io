Your streaming or download services audio files are not lossless.
They lose everything but the sound.

Piracy reduced the music experience to an audio file download, and now paid music services are competing with that model.

Streaming and download services claim to have reduced piracy, but how successful can they be while they continue to deal with music as clinically as (e.g.) Napster. Spreadsheet-like interfaces are convenient for listing thousands of tracks, but they to add depth to _experience_ of music ownership.

Popular services have solved the technical issue of music availability across devices and made discovering new music more convenient.
A track costs ~69p, about the same as a cigarette.
But the experience is cheapen too.

Finding and buying music would once have involved browsing plywood boxes in records stores.
Collecting music would have involved furniture.
Owning music would have exhibitionism built-in.
Interactions with audio mediums and players were tactile.
Those acts and commitments amounted to part of the _value_ of the _experience_ of owning music.


You can simulate physical mediums with digital files, but the experience doesn't end there.
