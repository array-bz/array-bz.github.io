  <p>
    Computing extends the human behavior which has evolved as a system of cooperating individuals.<br>
    A modern individual's computing ecosystem has been designed by a small number of organizations.<br>
    Some of those organizations have business models which distract from the design of tools to empower.<br>
    Email and internet are examples of distributed, decentralized systems, but the applications and services that run on them are largely centralized around a few organizations.<br>
    This centralization is limiting and has negative side effects.<br>
    Twitter, Facebook, Google etc. are compelled to police users of their systems in a way that walkie-talkie manufacturers are not.<br>
    Interactions between systems is limited to what vendors of those systems implement.<br>
    Service providers have server admin costs which means theyâ€™re limited to subscription-based or ad-based business models, regardless of whether that is the best model.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fundamentally, it's unlikely that we can exercise the full potential of computing if the interactions and data exchanges between different applications are constrained to the business models of a few organizations. The problem-space size is The Universe. Do we really want to choose between different vendor implementations of The Universe?<br>
    Organizations would need to forgo control of data in favor of the development of IP as a way to protect their business.<br>
    An open system of tools that allow individuals to host their own services such as email, file storage, music stream, domains could be developed by different vendors for different users. Then as users with software from different vendors wish to exchange messages, the formats become standardized and the focus for tools is on suitability and quality of functionality rather than control of data. Data, and access to data is decided by the user. Companies make money from making better tools.

  <p>
    Mobile devices are described as The Sun(http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/13/the-smartphone-and-the-sun), in a solar system system of devices and applications. Their provide cyborg-like capabilities that augment and expedite the behaviors of an individual. They are the device best positioned to facilitate autonomy.<br>
    But they don't host an individuals services. That's a missing piece.<br>
    Everyone has their own set of applications and services.<br>
    Until they become a network of applications and services, they're in a similar position to PCs before the internet.<br>
