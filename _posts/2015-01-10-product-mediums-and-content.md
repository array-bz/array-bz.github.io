This is a purist's rant about experiences of digital content.


Digital mediums compete with their content for the users attention.  
Branding and functionality litters what should be a pure content experience.
When someone sees me using Spotify, they see me using _Spotify_ more than they see what song I'm listening to. When I use Flickr to browse photos, it is near impossible to see _only_ the photo without Follow, Like or Share buttons being part of the scene.

These two examples represent best in class applications.  
Even so, I'd like to see them less, and the content more.  
It would be a more valuable content experience.**


** like I said, this is a purists rant.
